    "From our confidence interval, we found that we are 90% confident that the population proportion of all students who believe that their usage of social media affects their academic performance falls in the range (0.614, 0.672). The true population proportion has either a 0% or 100% chance of falling within this range, but we are 90% confident that the true proportion is actually in the interval we computed. From our hypothesis test, we got a p-value of 0.512, which means that 0.512 is the probability of observing a sample mean as extreme or more extreme than we observed, assuming that the average number of hours per day spent on social media platforms for students age 16-25 is 5 hours. We failed to reject the null hypothesis that the average number of hours per day spent on social media platforms for students age 16-25 is 5 hours, since our significance level of 0.05 is less than our p-value of 0.512.

    "Limitations that we faced working with this were the limited size of the dataset and the way the data was gathered. Although the dataset is representative of our population, it was rather small, with only 705 students. If more students were recorded, the data would be more diverse. Additionally, the data was collected through a survey rather than a random observed sample. This could affect the results, as students may interpret the numbers regarding their mental health level differently, and whether they believe that social media impacts their academic performance is subjective.
